# LXD-Nomad

*LXD-Nomad* is a wrapper around lxd that allows a workflow similar to Vagrant.

## Status

Barely functional, work in progress.

## Requirements

* A functional LXD. You should be able to run `lxc launch` and have a container with an IPv4
  address running.
* Proper permissions to run the `lxc` command. That usually means adding your user to the `lxd`
  group.
* Local LXD images. *LXD-Nomad* doesn't manage image copying. When you refer to `debian/jessie`, you need
  to have already coplied the image locally and properly aliased it.
* pylxd
* ansible

## Usage

It's not functional, so you can't use it, but if you put a `.nomad.yml` somewhere that looks
like:

```
name: myproject
image: debian/jessie
privileged: true # jessie is systemd
hostnames:
  - myproject.local
provisioning:
  - type: ansible
    playbook: deploy/site.yml
```

... and that you have a pre-configured `jessie` container that works, you should be able to get
*something* out of `nomad` commands made in the same folder.

## Privileged containers

There seems to be some problems with containers running systemd-based systems. Their init system
seem broken. You can confirm this by trying to `exec bash` into the container and try to execute
`systemctl`. If you get a dbus-related error, then yup, your container is broken and you need to
run the container as privileged.

## Why?

Vagrant has been designed with Virtualbox and x86 in mind. Yes, there are plugins like
`vagrant-lxc` that work quite well, but the main problem is when you try getting outside the x86
architecture. Vagrant boxes supports multiple providers, but not multiple arches.

To have a functional vagrant-based project tha can run, for example, on an ARM machine, you would
need to fudge your `Vagrantfile` to dynamically change the active box based on the current arch.

Also, when working with containers, much of the complexity of Vagrant becomes useless. Why
the need for special "vagrant-prepared" boxes when `lxc exec` is available? It's much simpler to
use whatever images are provided directly by lxd. By removing the need to manage boxes, `nomad`
suddenly becomes much simpler (a simple wrapper around lxd, really).
